# Diabetes Prediction Model Evaluation

## Overview
This project is a model evaluation on a diabetes dataset provided by my professor. For this task, we wee given the constraints of implementing serveral models - consisting of the following: Logisitc Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Boosted Trees, and several Neural Networks - a Multi-Layer Perceptron, a Deep Neural Network, and a CNN.
